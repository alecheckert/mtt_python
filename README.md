# mtt_python

Python implementation of the multiple-target tracing (MTT) algorithm for localization and tracking of fluorophores in fast super-resolution microscopy data. Takes Nikon ND2 files (and soon TIF files) as input and generates localization and tracking data readable by MATLAB and other programs.

Requires the [https://pypi.org/project/nd2reader/](nd2reader) package.
